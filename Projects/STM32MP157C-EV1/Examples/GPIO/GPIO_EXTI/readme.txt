@par Example Description

How to configure external interrupt lines.

In this example, one EXTI line (EXTI14) is configured to generate
an interrupt on each falling edge.
In the interrupt routine a led connected to a specific GPIO pin is toggled.

In this example:
    - EXTI14 is connected to PA14 pin
      - when falling edge is detected on EXTI14 by pressing User PA14 push-button, LED4 toggles once

On STM32MP157C-EV1:
    - EXTI14 is connected to User PA14 push-button

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the systick.
Then the System clock source is configured by the SystemClock_Config() function in case of Engineering Mode, this clock configuration is done
by the Firmware running on the Cortex-A7 in case of Production Mode.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The example needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.
